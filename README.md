# Defi Threat Modeling
This repo comprises of material related to threat modelling of DEFI and other Blockchain related Ecosystem

## DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
| Proposal Maker      | Voter          | Voting Power       | Smart Contracts             | Oracle             | Treasury          |

| <details><summary>Malicious Proposals</summary>*DAOs beauty is that anyone can submit a proposal. Generally the verification of the proposal lies with the voters and the community. If a Malicious proposal is submiited and not examined and verfied correctly it can have a devastating effects. The classic example to Malicos Proposal Attack is of Tornado Cash in which attacker submitted a malious proposal and gained control over the DAO.

This can arise due to the logic flaw in the code of voting code.It is recommended checking the following scenarios:<br><br>vote → transfer → vote again;<br>vote → delegate → vote again;<br>mangle a vote() arguments to add extra voting power;<br>check for reentrancy.*</details>  | <details><summary>Flash Loans Attack</summary>*A Flash Loan Attack is a type of exploit , where an attacker takes advantage of the flash loan feature to manipulate market/protocol conditions. In this type of attack, a malicious actor borrows a large amount of cryptocurrency through a flash loan, uses it to manipulate the market prices of assets, and then repays the loan within the same transaction block. In case of DAOs attacker can use flash loan to gain high amount of voting power and execute proposal in the same block.<br>Example:<br>https://bean.money/blog/beanstalk-governance-exploit<br>https://medium.com/@nvy_0x/the-beanstalk-bean-exploit-b038f4d324ea*</details> | Code Issues                 | Price Manipulation | Key Compromise    | 
| <details><summary>Voter Bribing</summary>*Voter Bribing in DAOs refers to a malicious practice where an entity offers incentives, to members of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) in exchange for their voting power or specific voting actions. The intent behind this is usually to manipulate the decision-making process of the DAO to achieve outcomes favorable to the attacker, which may not necessarily be in the best interests of the DAO or its broader community. The likelyhood of this attack depends upon the value to be extracted from the sucessfull exploitation. It should be +ve after the incentives offered to the voters.*</details>       | <details><summary>51% Attack</summary>*In terms of DAO 51% Attack refers to the term in which an attacker gains more the 2/3 of the voting power and affects the outcome of the proposal. An attacker pocessing 51% of the voting power can unilateraly pass the proposal. Flash Loan attacks can be considered a type of 51% Attack.<br>Aragon DAO faced the similar attack but averted it https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-repurposes-dao-to-ensure-treasury-serves-its-mission/*</details>     |                    | Business Logic Issues       |                    | Goverance Exploit |
| <details><summary>Sybil Attack</summary>*A Sybil Attack in the context of DAOs is when an attacker creates multiple fake identities, or controls a large number of accounts, in order to exert disproportionate influence over the decision-making process. By flooding the network with these identities, the attacker seeks to manipulate voting or consensus mechanisms in the DAO to their advantage, often at the expense of other participants and the overall health of the system.<br>Example of Sybil Attack can be SteemIt vs Justin Sun , where Sun gained control of the steemit network.*</details>        | Rushing Attack |                    | Upgrade Attacks             |                    |                   |

|                     |                |                    | Double Execution            |                    |                   |
